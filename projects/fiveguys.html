        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Five Guys</strong> is a satirical simulation game developed for the MQ Game Jam 2025 – Represent.
          The game puts players in charge of a five-person dev team, modeled after our real-life crew.
          Each team member works hard, but sometimes gets distracted, procrastinates, or needs a bathroom break.
          It’s your job to keep them on task and produce the most well-rounded game possible within a tight deadline.
        </p>
        <p>
          The player oversees the team from a top-down isometric view and must jump into action when someone goes idle.
          By clicking on a developer and using WASD controls, players guide them back to their station and keep progress on track across all disciplines: code, art, animation, and sound.
